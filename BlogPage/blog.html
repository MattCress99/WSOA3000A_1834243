                <h2>Libraries, Knowledge and the universe. An opinion on the works of <i>Vannevar Bush</i> and <i>Jorge Luis Borges</i></h2>
                    <p>
                        I recently had the pleasure of reading 3 excripts from 2 different novels and 1 essay by 2 excellent writers. The
                        novels were The Library of Babel<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">[1]</a> & The Garden of
                        Forking Paths<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">[2]</a> by <i>Jorge Luis Borges</i> and
                        an essay As We May Think<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think>[3]</a>by <i>Vannevar Bush</i>. The
                        stories were <span id="points">...</span>
                        <span id="moreText">
                        elaborate, well written and thought provoking. In
                        all the stories I seemed to find a common theme of libraries, collections of information. This theme is
                        most present in The Library of Babel in which Borges talks of the universe which is also known as the
                        library. It is made up of a series of identical hexagonal-shaped rooms. These rooms are filled with
                        books, all the books that one can ever imagine and not imagine. The Library of Babel is filled with all
                        the information in the universe that was ever created and thought of as well as all the information that
                        was never created or though of. It contains all the words ever written and all the words not written… I
                        think you get the point. I found this idea of a library of endless information very similar to the
                        internet. The internet is something we use every single day and its size is continually growing. More
                        users are creating pages and websites, making comments and posting videos. The library of information
                        that is tangible to us on a daily basis is essentially infinite. At the moment the internet is
                        unfortunately finite but its wealth of information is so large that it may seem infinite for a humans
                        comparatively short time on this earth. It’s daunting, Mitch Kapor says it best “Getting information off
                        the internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant”. It contains so much information, one could
                        easily compare it to the Library of Babel that Borges describes. <br>

                        found all three extracts to touch on the subject of time, and more specifically preserving knowledge and
                        information for the rest of time. The Library of Babel is a collection of information that will exist
                        forever, humans will continuously traverse its depth in search of new information. The Garden of Forking
                        paths continuously presents a strong metaphor for time. “The garden of forking paths” is a metaphor or
                        an idea of the infinitely dividing paths of time. He attempts to convey the message that time is not one
                        singular thing but rather a series of continuously twisting, colliding and diverging paths that all
                        exist in one singular spectrum. Bush touches on the aspect of time and the idea of preserving or
                        extending human knowledge, as well as the ability to collect, arrange and store all of this knowledge
                        for the rest of time. I find what these authors describe to be terrifyingly similar to the internet. The
                        internet is infinite, once something is on the internet it is almost undoubtedly going to remain there
                        for the rest of time or for as long as ‘the internet’ still exists. Just as the library of Babel will
                        exist for ever, and the garden of forking paths will continue to twist through time so will the internet
                        continually growing, twist and exist. <br>

                    <p>
                        <span id="moreText3">
                        I for one, stand on the side of the internet and hold it above all other libraries that Borges and Bush
                        may speak off. The reason why I say this, is merely because of the fact that the internet is more than
                        just a library or collection, it is a browser. The internet is seemingly infinite but because it is a
                        browser it can be searched through and order. Unlike the Library of Babel one can easily find anything
                        they are looking for on the internet with a simple search on the search bar. No information is hidden,
                        nothing is unobtainable. All the information of the world is at our finger tips with one click of a
                        button. The internet is an extraordinary invention, it is the triumph of humanity.<br>

                <h2>The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture</h2>
                    <p>
                            These days I find myself feeling very anxious. They say that the youth of today have more to think about
                            on a daily basis than any other generation ever. It sounds more like a flex for millennials and gen-z,
                            but it makes sense. Think about the average teenager’s cell phone, an extraordinarily large amount of
                            information and data will pass through that phone on a daily basis. Most teenagers are going to process
                            some, if not all, of that information. Cell phones are a relatively new technology that has shown great
                            strides in development over the last decade or so. The introduction of the internet or World Wide Web on
                            cellular devices and computers made gaining access to information significantly easier. <span id="points">...</span>
                            <span id="moreText">
                            The internet was
                            able to simultaneously connect the entire world together, making the transfer and exchange of
                            information more efficient. Development of new technologies such as smartphones and laptops and software
                            such as Google, Facebook and Twitter have also made it easier for us to collect, store and share vast
                            quantities of information. Studies have shown that approximately 380 websites are created every minute
                            and more than 65 Billion WhatsApp messages are sent daily. With all this information out there that we
                            are having to continuously process, it’s no mystery that the youth of today are feeling stressed out and
                            anxious.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            These changing technologies have a huge impact on our lives, and in today’s society a big part of
                            everyone’s life is internet culture. The internet has become so deeply integrated into society that
                            without it, I believe, society would fall into utter chaos. There is no way to hide from internet
                            culture as it is so deeply integrated in the functioning of society. It makes itself present in all
                            parts of life. Internet culture can spread through various forms, one of the most popular categories are
                            memes. Memes are typically humorous in nature, they can consist of an image, video, piece of text etc.
                            They are generally copied and imitated with slight variations and then spread rapidly across the
                            internet and social media by internet users. Memes are becoming more than just a source of humour or
                            entertainment. Memes are used to share political, social and spiritual beliefs. They are used to share
                            news. They are used to comment on social injustice, sometimes they are even created just to waste
                            another person’s time. Internet culture can also appear through forms of fake news. Fake news is
                            becoming more prevalent. It is difficult to tell the difference between fake news and real news and this
                            makes it dangerous. Users are becoming sceptical of any information that comes from the internet. Anyone
                            has the ability to create something and post it on the internet. Websites, posts and comments get shared
                            thousands of times. Sometimes, the information that is shared can be fake which can lead to serious harm
                            or detriment 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            One can distinctly correlate the development in technology to an increase and spread of internet
                            culture. As more technology that could access the internet became more easily available, more people
                            from around the world could start connecting themselves to the global network at more affordable prices.
                            When more people are using the internet, more information is being taken in and added to the network.
                            Internet culture is constantly being developed, and the more people there are who are able to access the
                            internet the faster internet culture will grow and spread.

            <h2>Browsing life</h2>
                <p>
                        I’ve been thinking a lot about browsers recently. They are fantastic inventions don't you think? Google
                        is a browser and I think most of us agree that it's one of the most utilised inventions ever. Imagine if
                        we had no way to browse the internet, that's a lot of information we need to be able to sort through. We
                        would be lost without any way to search through and find specific things in that great expanse of
                        information. Essentially all that information is useless until there is a way to categorize, sort
                        through and search through all of it.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what exactly is a browser? In today's society, the main browsers we come across are web browsers like
                        google which I spoke about earlier. Browsers are generally collections of information, like libraries,
                        but we can search through and order all of it. A web browser or internet browser is a software
                        application that lets people from all over the world access the world wide web. Basically, it gives you
                        access to the entirety of the world's information. Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and
                        Microsoft Edge are all browsers that the world commonly uses on a daily basis.
                    
                </p>
                <P>
                    Web browsers generally work by sending and receiving information to and from other parts of the web.
                        When the information is received it is displayed on your browser window. Text, images, and video files
                        are transported around the web using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Web browsers use a user
                        interface to display information graphically, this is known as the frontend and it allows for navigation
                        of web pages. However, data is handled in the backend. The backend (such as servers and databases) sends
                        data out across the internet, based on your actions, and carries the data received back to you so that
                        you can connect to the websites you visit and interact with them.
                    
                </P>
                <p>
                   My favourite browsers are music browsers. Music is a big part of my life and there's no way I would ever
                        be able to remember all the songs I like to listen to. So having amazing music browsers like Soundcloud,
                        Spotify, and Apple music really makes my life a lot easier. As an aspiring DJ, I need a way to keep
                        track of all my songs and make sure that I keep the songs I want to play one day in one place so I don't
                        lose and forget about them over time.
                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    I find it beautiful that humans want to store and keep the information they’ve collected for future
                        generations to use. We constantly grow as a society and help each other to improve. My drive to gain new
                        information is inspiring and pushes me to grow and learn more each day.

            <h2>The medium is the message, an interesting idea about the way we view things in society</h2>
                <p>
                    “We are too prone to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield them.
                        The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that
                        determines their value.” - General David Sarnoff
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                        I recently had the pleasure of listening too and reading some of Marshall McLuhan, a canadian philosopher’s, work. He
                        speaks extensively of the idea that “the medium is the message”. He attempts to convey the idea that nothing is in
                        itself inherently good or bad. Everything in the world exists neutrally. It is how this thing is used that determines
                        its constitution. For instance “Firearms are in themselves neither good nor bad; it is the way they are used that
                        determines their value.” I believe this to be completely true, and something that is seen very prevently in today's
                        society. I feel the best example one can use to explain this, is social media and the internet as a whole. The internet
                        exists as a completely neutral platform. It is neither good nor bad, it is only a library. A place for us to store
                        thoughts, ideas and creations. How we intend to use these thoughts, ideas and creations determines whether it is
                        something positive or negative, good or bad. For instance advertising. Advertising is at the forefront of all
                        development. Advertising can be seen anywhere, on the internet, the television or even on the road while you drive.
                        Advertising is not good or bad, and it generally has no effect on us. However, what is being advertised does have an
                        effect on us. An advert telling you to kill puppies would be considered inherently bad would it not? What if the advert
                        told you to kill puppies for the sake of mankind's survival? Would it then still be considered ‘bad’.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                        The point I am trying to highlight is that not all information is inherently good or bad, almost all of the things we
                        see and hear today have hidden agendas behind them. It is impossible to place anything we see these days on a side
                        between good or bad as the lines of good and bad have been mixed together and blurred. Nowadays it is up to us to decide
                        the nature of things. And this is something that is becoming increasingly more difficult.
                   
                </p>
                <p>
                   
                        Humans have different views on different things, it is our differences that make us unique is it not? So with this said
                        I believe that is extremely important that we stay vigilant in our daily lives and put more thought into the things we
                        read online. With fake news being so prevalent it can be very tricky to tell whether the information you are receiving
                        is legitimate. Marshall details the dangers of this situation well. “The paradox of mechanization is that although it is
                        itself the cause of maximal growth and change, the principle of mechanization excludes the very possibility of growth or
                        the understanding of change.” Meaning that although we have the means to create growth and change through the gain of
                        new information, more often than not we are unable to predict what growth that change or new information will cause. And
                        whether that growth will be beneficial or detrimental to society. I believe that as the world becomes more educated we
                        are better able to use the information we receive for good. As global communication improves it becomes harder to keep
                        things hidden. Agendas are displayed openly on News headlines, people's lives and thoughts are contained in websites and
                        social media posts and captions. We are all becoming more and more connected and as we grow and connect it is up to us
                        to prosper this growth in a positive direction. One that will benefit all members of society. Growth is neither
                        inherently good or bad, it is why we grow, what we grow into and what that growth is used for that determines its value.

            <h2>Innovation through minimal effort, a brief history of web robots</h2>
                <p>
                    
                        We all know what robots are. We have seen them in movies like Terminator and i-robot, or those metal arms that are in
                        factory production lines and NASA science videos. However, did you know that there are also robots that exist on the
                        internet or on our computers and phones? Web robots or ‘bots’ are in fact extremely common and we use or get affected by
                        bots on a daily basis. For instance, Googlebot, which allows us to quickly find the most relevant search results on
                        Google by searching through millions of webpages in seconds. Websites use chatbots to communicate with their visitors.
                        There are also malicious bots such as GTbot which was one of the first malicious botnet programs created in 2000 that
                        was capable of denial of service attacks (DoS attacks). These attacks are cyber-attacks which are designed to shut down
                        a machine or network and make it inaccessible to the users trying to access it. Another botnet program that emerged in
                        2007, Storm, was believed to have infected over 50 million computers and was used for many types of crimes including
                        stock price fraud and identity theft.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                        Bots are woven into today’s society and carry out almost all menial tasks that occur on the internet. It is common
                        practice for computer programmers to make bots that perform functions for them, in fact it is one of the first things
                        you will be taught to do if you learn to code in a computer language. Websites, programs, applications and even video
                        games use bots for all sorts of purposes. I personally think it is quite brilliant thinking. Imagine you are a video
                        game designer and you have to create a video game. You are going to have millions of lines of code to create, sift
                        through and test. Quite honestly it seems like an impossible task, but because of bots and really clever people, we have
                        found ways to make this task possible. For instance testing bots, if you’ve got a million lines of code and a couple
                        thousand functions running at once you will want ways of ensuring that all the functions are running correctly before
                        you even start the program, otherwise things are going to mess up big time somewhere along the way. So people create
                        testing bots that are used to test functions before they run to see if they are working correctly. These things become
                        quite important when you are working with people’s lives, for instance NASA engineers who design rockets, their programs
                        need to have the speed and accuracy that bots provide in order to tell them if something is going wrong before it
                        becomes a problem. Or if you work in artificial intelligence, when creating neural network programs that can sometimes
                        take months on end to run you want to make sure everything is running correctly before you start it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, why am I telling you all this information about bots? Well it’s because I think they are really important, we’ve
                    been using them all this time, so we should know what they are. They affect us every single day and they can make our
                    lives both easier and more challenging. I believe robots give a very accurate and funny insight into human nature. Bots
                    are a perfect example of human intelligence coupled with human laziness. We’re so smart that we create things that do
                    things for us, so we don’t have to do them again.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                   Quite funny, isn’t it.

                <h2>Design in our daily</h2>
                    <p>
                        It feels as though ‘design’ has been deeply incorporated into my everyday life. Whether it be through music and mixing
                        songs to design sounds and emotions, through the creation of this website, or even through the cup of coffee I make each
                        morning. I feel like we are all constantly designing. The outfits we wear and messages we construct over our phones are
                        all products of design. And it seems the more and more we design the more beautiful this world is becoming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Design is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order” according to Victor Papane in his book Design
                        for the Real World. In it, he states that all men are designers. Personally, I agree with this statement, but I feel
                        like this statement is not broad enough. I believe that all Beings are designers. Not just humans, all living creatures
                        design. A great example of this is the ornate and beautiful geometric designs created in the sand by the male puffer
                        fish in the seas of Japan, in order to attract a mate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is design in everything. Papane says “We constantly try to understand our ever-changingly highly complex existence
                        by seeking order in it. And what we seek we find.” There is pattern and design all around us, it can be seen in the
                        perfect hexagons of honeycombs or how often the Fibonacci sequence presents itself so perfectly in nature. A great
                        example of this can be seen in the petals of flowers. Most have 3 (like lilies), 5 (like parnassia), 8 (like cosmea), or
                        13 (like daisies). This goes on and you will always find that the number of petals a flower has (if not damaged)
                        corresponds to one of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Design is highly integrated into nature, everything has a
                        purpose and happens for a reason, and as Papane says “The reason we enjoy things in nature is that we see an economy of
                        means, simplicity, elegance, and an essential rightness there.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is always a reason for the design, no matter how simple. But beauty in design cannot be truly be achieved without
                        understanding the function of the design, the reason for it to be created in the first place. Papane highlights this
                        point in his writings when he states that “The mode of action by which a design fulfills its purpose is its function”. I
                        find this to be highly useful when designing anything myself. I personally feel like I can’t start to create a good
                        design before I know what the function of that design is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A point that Papane so clearly defines in his writings is that design must be ‘meaningful’ as we as humans respond to
                        that which has meaning. And in order to create this meaning, we must make correct use of the tools, materials, and
                        processes we have at hand in our environment.

                <h2>Usability & Accessibility on the web</h2>
                    <p>
                        Today I was presented with an interesting idea about Usability and accessibility on the internet. When I heard those
                        words, at first I had no idea what they actually meant. But after looking it up I found out that ‘web accessibility is a
                        seriously important thing and so is web usability. Web accessibility allows for people with disabilities to equally
                        perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools and it allows them to contribute to the internet
                        freely. Usability refers to the effectiveness of the design of a product or in this case website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both these ideas are two significantly important factors that one has to take into account when creating things on the
                        web. I for one had not thought of this until reading about it and feel rather ignorant for not doing so. And the thing
                        is, a lot of people don’t think about it. Disabled people make up 15% of our population, that’s a significant amount of
                        people, around 1 billion to be specific. So how can we improve our designs to cater to the needs of these people?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some ways might be in how you make the website look, using high contrast can benefit people on mobile devices,
                        especially in sunlight or a dark room. Captions and text allow people in noisy or quiet environments as well as people
                        who are hearing impaired to utilize videos or sounds. Websites need to ensure that assistive reading technology such as
                        screen readers and screen magnifiers that enlarge content works on the website. Voice recognition software used to input
                        text, as well as text to speech technology, are both important and must be thought about. It is important to take these
                        factors into account so that people with disabilities aren’t excluded from using the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A brilliant definition of usability by ISO 9241-11 is “The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to
                        achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use.” It is important
                        that websites are designed with these goals and contexts in mind so that no barriers are created that exclude people
                        from accessing the internet.

                <h2>What is information geography and why does it matter</h2>
                    <p>
                        Information geography refers to the way information is created, used, and distributed throughout the world.
                        Specifically, it refers to where Internet content is being created, whether the amount of content that gets created in
                        different places changes over time and the ways in which landscapes of content have been structured and formed (Mark
                        Graham 2014). It is important that we consider digital divides in the world in order to develop strategies that help us
                        break down those divides so that we can all ultimately benefit from the internet and help include those who are left out
                        of the flow of information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The internet is not something that exists within a location less cloud, with infinite storage space and bandwidth. The
                        internet is characterised by distinct geographies such as servers and websites. All the tiniest bits of information from
                        scripts to search bots must exist somewhere. This is why it is important to understand our geography or data shadows so
                        that we can more accurately include those that are left out of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of January 2021, there were 5.66 billion active internet users, which’s almost 60% of our population. In our past
                        information about the world has been highly geographically contained and it took time for news of new discoveries and
                        inventions to travel. We would require media to convey that information or people themselves would have to spread that
                        information, through various methods such as media and word of mouth. Distance has a significant impact on the ability
                        of information to spread. For example, maps from the early 13th and 14th centuries would often contain rather accurate
                        information about the area in which the cartographers would live, however, as you got further and further away from the
                        origin of the cartographer, the information became less accurate and to some degree almost none existent. This is
                        because 13th and 14th-century methods of transportation and communication were far and few and were pretty much limited
                        to ships, words, and books. Today we have significantly more means of transportation and communication that allow for
                        information to spread more easily across the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the vast increase in internet connectivity across the world, it can still be seen that there are areas that
                        produce and utilise significantly less information than other areas in the world. A perfect example of this is that
                        there are more than three times as many journals being published in Sweden as there are in the entire continent of
                        Africa. There is a centrality of the world’s information, and it can be found in a few distinct information cores or
                        world powers. It can be seen that there is not a lot of content created by the South and that there is not a lot of
                        content created about the South either. A lot of people, places, and knowledge are being left out because of these
                        divides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A large part of the solution to this problem of digital divides is to connect the previously disconnected. However,
                        there are many problems such as poverty, famine, education, culture, and religion that play a role in these digital
                        divides. But I believe that it is our goal as a society to strive for a more connected future so that we can tear down
                        these digital divides and grow together as a connected society.

                <h2>An insight into Jozi’s techno scene</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the things I fill my time with is techno. Music is one of the things I enjoy the most in this world and Techno is
                        one of my favourite genres. It is an extremely diverse genre of music, with variations in style from hard and fast
                        Berlin acid techno, to soft, slow, and rhythmic dub tech and everything else in between. The focus of this type of music
                        is more on the sound of it than the lyrics, and this is one of the things I enjoy the most about it. The sounds of the
                        songs create emotion within you, unlike most songs that get you to focus on their lyrics in order to draw meaning and
                        emotion from you when listening to it. This is why I feel techno is so well designed for a live experience. With their
                        train-like rhythms, techno sets keep crowds hooked to the dancefloor and make them forget about life as they get lost in
                        the trans-like beats of the song. These moments on the dancefloor, the ones that make you forget about all other moments
                        but the present, are the moments I live for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        South Africa has a very talented but small techno scene, that many would consider ‘underground’. I have been a part of
                        this scene for 4 years now, and it has become one that is very close to my heart. The community is tiny but friendly and
                        loving. I found myself meeting some techno legends almost as soon as I jumped on the scene. Artists like Dogstarr, Avi
                        Subban, The Lazarusman, black coffee, Mark Valsachie, Terry Aronis, G-force, Grant VR, and Fabio are familiar faces that
                        I see almost regularly and have had the pleasure of speaking with many times. This is due to the beauty and
                        interconnectedness of our local music scene. It is composed of a small but dedicated group of people who you will very
                        quickly meet (‘The regulars’ as they’re termed) at almost any event you go to in Jozi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The techno industry took a big hit over 2020, with the shutdown of clubs due to Covid-19. Many DJs and artists suddenly
                        found themselves with any form of income and no option to make more in the foreseeable future. Even to this day, the
                        techno scene is not what it used to be. Due to the presence of things such as curfew, limited venue capacities and
                        unpredictable alcohol restrictions, SA’s local artists were being faced with constant uncertainty and many struggled to
                        keep afloat. However, thanks to the dedication of SA’s techno lovers and partiers and with the ease of lockdown
                        restrictions and later curfews that we have seen over 2021, the local scene has been able to build itself back up. We
                        went from no events happening whatsoever to multiple events happening Thursday to Sunday every week and if we’re lucky
                        one or two mid-week events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot has happened for techno lovers in SA over the past year. Truth nightclub closed down after 21 years of partying at
                        the start of 2020. MUUDmovement, an event organizer started by my friends Claude, Sheldon, and Anthony almost 4 years
                        ago, has been making ripples in the scene and is slowly starting to take over with their new wave of high-energy acid
                        and hard techno. They’re pushing some really big names behind them and are throwing some gnarly memorable events. AND
                        club has been throwing a slurry of insane events over the past few months and they have some absolute bangers lined up
                        for the future. And of course, my boys and girls at NTFS (NoTimeForSpace) are making a huge name for themselves with
                        their first-ever event (Break-Fast Club) being nothing but an absolute success. They have their second one lined up for
                        us on the 19th of June and it’s sure to be even better than the first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Music is something that has a special place in my heart, and Techno has the biggest room in the house.
