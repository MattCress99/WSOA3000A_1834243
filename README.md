# Interactive Media website
This is the first draft of my website

This website is being designed to be used by NTFS, a music and events organiser based in South Africa.

This website is being deployed under the name Alain. It will later be released officially to the public under my real name Matthew Cresswell where it will be used full time by the NTFS crew.
