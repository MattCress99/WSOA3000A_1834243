            <h2>Libraries, Knowledge and the universe. An opinion on the works of <i>Vannevar Bush</i> and <i>Jorge Luis Borges</i></h2>
                <p>
                    <h5>I recently had the pleasure of reading 3 excripts from 2 different novels and 1 essay by 2 excellent writers. The
                    novels were The Library of Babel<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">[1]</a> & The Garden of
                    Forking Paths<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">[2]</a> by <i>Jorge Luis Borges</i> and
                    an essay As We May Think<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think>[3]</a>by <i>Vannevar Bush</i>. The
                    stories were
                    elaborate, well written and thought provoking. In
                    all the stories I seemed to find a common theme of libraries, collections of information. This theme is
                    most present in The Library of Babel in which Borges talks of the universe which is also known as the
                    library. It is made up of a series of identical hexagonal-shaped rooms. These rooms are filled with
                    books, all the books that one can ever imagine and not imagine. The Library of Babel is filled with all
                    the information in the universe that was ever created and thought of as well as all the information that
                    was never created or though of. It contains all the words ever written and all the words not written… I
                    think you get the point. I found this idea of a library of endless information very similar to the
                    internet. The internet is something we use every single day and its size is continually growing. More
                    users are creating pages and websites, making comments and posting videos. The library of information
                    that is tangible to us on a daily basis is essentially infinite. At the moment the internet is
                    unfortunately finite but its wealth of information is so large that it may seem infinite for a humans
                    comparatively short time on this earth. It’s daunting, Mitch Kapor says it best “Getting information off
                    the internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant”. It contains so much information, one could
                    easily compare it to the Library of Babel that Borges describes. <br>
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>found all three extracts to touch on the subject of time, and more specifically preserving knowledge and
                        information for the rest of time. The Library of Babel is a collection of information that will exist
                        forever, humans will continuously traverse its depth in search of new information. The Garden of Forking
                        paths continuously presents a strong metaphor for time. “The garden of forking paths” is a metaphor or
                        an idea of the infinitely dividing paths of time. He attempts to convey the message that time is not one
                        singular thing but rather a series of continuously twisting, colliding and diverging paths that all
                        exist in one singular spectrum. Bush touches on the aspect of time and the idea of preserving or
                        extending human knowledge, as well as the ability to collect, arrange and store all of this knowledge
                        for the rest of time. I find what these authors describe to be terrifyingly similar to the internet. The
                        internet is infinite, once something is on the internet it is almost undoubtedly going to remain there
                        for the rest of time or for as long as ‘the internet’ still exists. Just as the library of Babel will
                        exist for ever, and the garden of forking paths will continue to twist through time so will the internet
                        continually growing, twist and exist. <br>
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>I for one, stand on the side of the internet and hold it above all other libraries that Borges and Bush
                        may speak off. The reason why I say this, is merely because of the fact that the internet is more than
                        just a library or collection, it is a browser. The internet is seemingly infinite but because it is a
                        browser it can be searched through and order. Unlike the Library of Babel one can easily find anything
                        they are looking for on the internet with a simple search on the search bar. No information is hidden,
                        nothing is unobtainable. All the information of the world is at our finger tips with one click of a
                        button. The internet is an extraordinary invention, it is the triumph of humanity.<br>

            <h2>The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture</h2>
                <p>
                    <h5>These days I find myself feeling very anxious. They say that the youth of today have more to think about
                        on a daily basis than any other generation ever. It sounds more like a flex for millennials and gen-z,
                        but it makes sense. Think about the average teenager’s cell phone, an extraordinarily large amount of
                        information and data will pass through that phone on a daily basis. Most teenagers are going to process
                        some, if not all, of that information. Cell phones are a relatively new technology that has shown great
                        strides in development over the last decade or so. The introduction of the internet or World Wide Web on
                        cellular devices and computers made gaining access to information significantly easier. The internet was
                        able to simultaneously connect the entire world together, making the transfer and exchange of
                        information more efficient. Development of new technologies such as smartphones and laptops and software
                        such as Google, Facebook and Twitter have also made it easier for us to collect, store and share vast
                        quantities of information. Studies have shown that approximately 380 websites are created every minute
                        and more than 65 Billion WhatsApp messages are sent daily. With all this information out there that we
                        are having to continuously process, it’s no mystery that the youth of today are feeling stressed out and
                        anxious.
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>These changing technologies have a huge impact on our lives, and in today’s society a big part of
                        everyone’s life is internet culture. The internet has become so deeply integrated into society that
                        without it, I believe, society would fall into utter chaos. There is no way to hide from internet
                        culture as it is so deeply integrated in the functioning of society. It makes itself present in all
                        parts of life. Internet culture can spread through various forms, one of the most popular categories are
                        memes. Memes are typically humorous in nature, they can consist of an image, video, piece of text etc.
                        They are generally copied and imitated with slight variations and then spread rapidly across the
                        internet and social media by internet users. Memes are becoming more than just a source of humour or
                        entertainment. Memes are used to share political, social and spiritual beliefs. They are used to share
                        news. They are used to comment on social injustice, sometimes they are even created just to waste
                        another person’s time. Internet culture can also appear through forms of fake news. Fake news is
                        becoming more prevalent. It is difficult to tell the difference between fake news and real news and this
                        makes it dangerous. Users are becoming sceptical of any information that comes from the internet. Anyone
                        has the ability to create something and post it on the internet. Websites, posts and comments get shared
                        thousands of times. Sometimes, the information that is shared can be fake which can lead to serious harm
                        or detriment </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>One can distinctly correlate the development in technology to an increase and spread of internet
                        culture. As more technology that could access the internet became more easily available, more people
                        from around the world could start connecting themselves to the global network at more affordable prices.
                        When more people are using the internet, more information is being taken in and added to the network.
                        Internet culture is constantly being developed, and the more people there are who are able to access the
                        internet the faster internet culture will grow and spread.

            <h2>Browsing life</h2>
                <p>
                    <h5>I’ve been thinking a lot about browsers recently. They are fantastic inventions don't you think? Google
                        is a browser and I think most of us agree that it's one of the most utilised inventions ever. Imagine if
                        we had no way to browse the internet, that's a lot of information we need to be able to sort through. We
                        would be lost without any way to search through and find specific things in that great expanse of
                        information. Essentially all that information is useless until there is a way to categorize, sort
                        through and search through all of it.
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>So what exactly is a browser? In today's society, the main browsers we come across are web browsers like
                        google which I spoke about earlier. Browsers are generally collections of information, like libraries,
                        but we can search through and order all of it. A web browser or internet browser is a software
                        application that lets people from all over the world access the world wide web. Basically, it gives you
                        access to the entirety of the world's information. Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and
                        Microsoft Edge are all browsers that the world commonly uses on a daily basis.
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <P>
                    <h5>Web browsers generally work by sending and receiving information to and from other parts of the web.
                        When the information is received it is displayed on your browser window. Text, images, and video files
                        are transported around the web using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Web browsers use a user
                        interface to display information graphically, this is known as the frontend and it allows for navigation
                        of web pages. However, data is handled in the backend. The backend (such as servers and databases) sends
                        data out across the internet, based on your actions, and carries the data received back to you so that
                        you can connect to the websites you visit and interact with them.
                    </h5>
                </P>
                <p>
                    <h5>My favourite browsers are music browsers. Music is a big part of my life and there's no way I would ever
                        be able to remember all the songs I like to listen to. So having amazing music browsers like Soundcloud,
                        Spotify, and Apple music really makes my life a lot easier. As an aspiring DJ, I need a way to keep
                        track of all my songs and make sure that I keep the songs I want to play one day in one place so I don't
                        lose and forget about them over time.
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>I find it beautiful that humans want to store and keep the information they’ve collected for future
                        generations to use. We constantly grow as a society and help each other to improve. My drive to gain new
                        information is inspiring and pushes me to grow and learn more each day.

            <h2>The medium is the message, an interesting idea about the way we view things in society</h2>
                <p>
                    <h5>“We are too prone to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield them.
                        The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that
                        determines their value.” - General David Sarnoff
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>
                        I recently had the pleasure of listening too and reading some of Marshall McLuhan, a canadian philosopher’s, work. He
                        speaks extensively of the idea that “the medium is the message”. He attempts to convey the idea that nothing is in
                        itself inherently good or bad. Everything in the world exists neutrally. It is how this thing is used that determines
                        its constitution. For instance “Firearms are in themselves neither good nor bad; it is the way they are used that
                        determines their value.” I believe this to be completely true, and something that is seen very prevently in today's
                        society. I feel the best example one can use to explain this, is social media and the internet as a whole. The internet
                        exists as a completely neutral platform. It is neither good nor bad, it is only a library. A place for us to store
                        thoughts, ideas and creations. How we intend to use these thoughts, ideas and creations determines whether it is
                        something positive or negative, good or bad. For instance advertising. Advertising is at the forefront of all
                        development. Advertising can be seen anywhere, on the internet, the television or even on the road while you drive.
                        Advertising is not good or bad, and it generally has no effect on us. However, what is being advertised does have an
                        effect on us. An advert telling you to kill puppies would be considered inherently bad would it not? What if the advert
                        told you to kill puppies for the sake of mankind's survival? Would it then still be considered ‘bad’.
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>
                        The point I am trying to highlight is that not all information is inherently good or bad, almost all of the things we
                        see and hear today have hidden agendas behind them. It is impossible to place anything we see these days on a side
                        between good or bad as the lines of good and bad have been mixed together and blurred. Nowadays it is up to us to decide
                        the nature of things. And this is something that is becoming increasingly more difficult.
                    </h5>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>
                        Humans have different views on different things, it is our differences that make us unique is it not? So with this said
                        I believe that is extremely important that we stay vigilant in our daily lives and put more thought into the things we
                        read online. With fake news being so prevalent it can be very tricky to tell whether the information you are receiving
                        is legitimate. Marshall details the dangers of this situation well. “The paradox of mechanization is that although it is
                        itself the cause of maximal growth and change, the principle of mechanization excludes the very possibility of growth or
                        the understanding of change.” Meaning that although we have the means to create growth and change through the gain of
                        new information, more often than not we are unable to predict what growth that change or new information will cause. And
                        whether that growth will be beneficial or detrimental to society. I believe that as the world becomes more educated we
                        are better able to use the information we receive for good. As global communication improves it becomes harder to keep
                        things hidden. Agendas are displayed openly on News headlines, people's lives and thoughts are contained in websites and
                        social media posts and captions. We are all becoming more and more connected and as we grow and connect it is up to us
                        to prosper this growth in a positive direction. One that will benefit all members of society. Growth is neither
                        inherently good or bad, it is why we grow, what we grow into and what that growth is used for that determines its value.
